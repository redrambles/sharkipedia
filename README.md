# README

## Development setup

1. Ensure you have ruby (version 3.1) installed, for instructions see the
    [Install Rails Howto](http://installrails.com).
1. Ensure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
1. Ensure you have the postgresql database installed
    - macOS: `brew install postgresql` then follow instructions
    - windows: https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/, then follow
       instructions and make a note of the username & password
    - Linux: depending on your distribution install, configure and start
       postgresql:
        1. Create user in posgres: `sudo -u postgres createuser username`
        1. Give permission to user to create database:  `sudo -u postgres psql`
            and in the postgres terminal: `ALTER USER username CREATEDB;`
1. Ensure you have PostGIS installed. For instructions, check the
    [project's website](https://postgis.net/install/).
1. Clone the repository to your computer
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sharkipedia/sharkipedia.git
    ```
1. Move into the project folder (`cd sharkipedia`)
1. Install project dependencies: `bundle install`
1. Windows/Linux: in the `config/database.yml` configure the username and
   password under development which you set during the installation of
   postgresql.
   macOS: if you installed postgres with `brew` you don't need to do anything,
   if you installed postgres in another way you might have to configure
   a username and password
1. Initialize the database `rake db:setup` (if this command throws an
    `role "username" does not exist` or `permission denied to create database`
    error, see above to create postgres user and give permission)
1. Enable the PostGIS extension `rake db:gis:setup`
1. Run the rails server `rails server`
1. Connect to the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
